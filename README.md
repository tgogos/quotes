> *"If a manager wants to run a stable project, he would do well to follow this simple maxim: If a programmer is indispensable, get rid of him as quickly as possible."* <br> -Gerald M. Weinberg, The Psychology of Computer Programming


> *"At some point I made the decision to focus on foundational concepts; not features of a particular implementation; my tech career took off."* <br> -Kelsey Hightower @kelseyhightower

> *"Being the smartest person in the room is not enough if you don’t have the capacity to work with people who are in that room with you.

> *"Good design accelerates the adoption of new ideas."* <br> -Yves Behar

> *"There are only two hard problems in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things"* <br> -Phil Karlton

> *"We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection."* <br> -Fundamental theorem of software engineering (FTSE), a term originated by Andrew Koenig to describe a remark by Butler Lampson, attributed to the late David J. Wheeler. The theorem is often expanded by the humorous clause *"…except for the problem of too many levels of indirection"*.

2. The Fundamental Truths

   (1)  It Has To Work.

   (2)  No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,
        you can't increase the speed of light.

   (4)  Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
        networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
        builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
        network.

   (5)  It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate problems
        into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
        this is a bad idea.

   (6)  It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving
        the problem to a different part of the overall network
        architecture) than it is to solve it.

        (6a) (corollary). It is always possible to add another level of
             indirection.

   (7)  It is always something

        (7a) (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two (you can't
            have all three).

   (8)  It is more complicated than you think.

   (9)  For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.

       (9a) (corollary) Every networking problem always takes longer to
            solve than it seems like it should.

   (10) One size never fits all.

   (11) Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and
        a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.

        (11a) (corollary). See rule 6a.

   (12) In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there
        is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
        away.
